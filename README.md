# Glowing-Barnacle (CV Website)

A content-based project to demonstrate HTML, CSS & JS skills.

Named glowing-barnacle after GitHub suggested that as a repo name and I kinda liked it!

Whilst the barnalce remains attached, the aim is to give it a refreshed glow (new css stylesheet/s) in order to demonstrate/practice different layout techniques with a pre-defined content source.

New and existing developers can take the same approach with their own CVs. Create a semantic version of your own CV/Resum√© and then use it as the content to style to improve your frontend/presenation layer skills - but please, no progress bars!
