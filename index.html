        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a UX Developer / UI Engineer based in Glasgow. I love to
          interrogate problems and come up with creative solutions, learning as
          much as I can along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a UX Developer, I have a lot of exposure to working within agile
          teams, having been the UX specialist in a variety of different teams.
          I've help to guide product development with insights delivered through
          wireframes, interactive prototypes, visual documentation and various
          other UX artefacts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am able to use UX research insights and end-user empathy to inform
          the approaches taken. This allows me to be sure that the UI being
          developed and the flows being crafted for users to follow, will be
          ones that 'work' both in a technical sense and a human-centred one.

            <p>
              Providing educational support to students working through
              CareerFoundry's UX courses. In this role, I am paired with a
              Mentor that provides the students with feedback and insights on
              their portfolio and their professional development.
            </p>
            <p>
              I use my real-world experience in UX Design to help students get
              to grips with any area that they are unsure of, working with them
              to ensure they get to understand the subject content.
            </p>
            <p>
              My development experience gives me the additional benefit of being
              able to provide technical insight when it becomes relevant to
              their projects. I feel that this allows me to prepare them for
              working with developers in the future - having been on both sides
              of the process, I know the kind of issues that can crop up between
              the two.
            </p>
            <p>
              Strong interpersonal communication skills allow me to be able to
              deliver a technical explanation to those that aren’t necessarily
              technically minded themselves.

            <p>
              Led the UX design for a progressive WebApp that was being built to
              replace clients existing online offering. The legacy web-based
              application provided a lot of functionality to their existing
              customer base and this needed to be made available through a
              mobile-first interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project allowed updates to the existing task flows to be made
              to bring the interactions in line with people’s expectations when
              using such an app to perform various actions. This area needed to
              be handled with care so as to not alienate those members that have
              been using the platform for 10+ years.

            <p>
              With the rest of the development team as my users for this
              project, I designed the different screens and applied the visual
              styling from Semantic UI, the UI kit which is used to build the
              frontend. To supplement the visuals further, I used Semantic UI
              (React) to prototype UI components - once designed, these are then
              made available as template components.
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked alongside the Snr Developer in the team to ensure that we
              continued to adopt the agile process further, applying those
              facets which had the most impact within the team/project.

              I provided the UX/UI Designs for an online video-streaming

              ReactJS in order to supplement development team in bringing the
              application to fruition - this provided me with further insights
              that allowed me to consider additional options within the
              different stages of using the application.

              Analysed existing user research to improve task workflows for a

            <p>
              Overall this role saw me handling the creation of UI layouts and
              components within HTML/CSS and then breathing life into them with
              ReactJS.
